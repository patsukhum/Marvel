          In April 2019, Marvel’s most recent film, Avengers: Endgame came out, promptly smashing just about every
          box office record there is to smash (as well as much of [INSERT CITY HERE]). Not only did Endgame snag
          the record of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/22/20703487/avengers-endgame-avatar-biggest-movie-all-time-box-office">hugest opening weekend in the
            world at $1.2 billion</a>, but It blew past Avatar’s previous record of total box office revenue, reaching a
          new record of $2.79 billion in July.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, setting aside some notable exceptions like Avatar, it seems as though almost all the biggest
          movies these days are action-packed comic book stories adapted for the big screen. Let’s look at some data
          to see if this is really the case:

            Breaking down box office revenue by genre, one thing becomes apparent: comic book movies are truly
            dominant. [More remarks on trends that are apparent in the visualization, specific movies that should be
            highlighted in both the comic book and non-comic book genres].

              Without a doubt, the most dominant franchises in the comic book movie genre are Marvel and DC. Both the
              Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and DC Extended Universe (DCEU) have been churning out huge numbers of
              successful (and not so successful) movies, ever since Iron Man came out in 2008. Both stayed neck-and-neck
              in terms of yearly box office revenues until the mid 2010’s, after MCU’s [MOVIE] came out. After that,
              it’s simply no contest: MCU is the dominant comic book movie franchise (sorry DC fans).

              One of the defining features (one might say, 'superpowers') of the MCU is the sheer number of characters
              and stories that have been woven into its single timeline.
              Beginning with Iron Man in 2008, MCU began producing movies with increasing frequency and increasing success.
              Now in 2019, there have been a total of [NUMBER] MCU movies from [NUMBER] different series, with plans for
              [NUMBER] more.
            </p>

              However, a linear timeline hides the strength of MCU: the complexity of how the movies and characters
              interact with one another. The story of MCU is not linear, but is highly complex and branching. If you
              were watching all the MCU movies in one go (likely over many sittings - for your health!), you might do it
              in this order

          <div class="col">
            <p>
              And the complexity doesn’t end at the movie level! The relations between each of the many main characters
              in MCU are highly complex. To get a sense of this, we downloaded the Wikipedia pages of each MCU main
              character using the Wikimedia API and extracted the links between character pages. Each link feasibly
              represents some sort of relation between the two characters. For example, if Hawkeye links to Thor, then
              somewhere on Hawkeye’s page is a reference to Thor, meaning that the two characters did something
              together.
            </p>
            <p>We can analyze this graph to determine who the most “central” or “important” character is in the MCU[1].
              Based on Wikipedia links the most important character is… [drumroll please]
            </p>
            <p>
              Captain America!
            </p>
            <p>
              Surprising right! We thought it would be Iron Man, but it seems that Wikipedia had a different idea. Try
              hovering over the character bubbles to see more statistics grabbed from Wikipedia
            </p>

              Of course, the relationships between characters are only part of the story. These are superheros after
              all - what about their powers? We can look at two kinds of data: abilities (quantitative traits such as
              speed, strength, etc) and powers (specific superpowers such as healing, flight, etc.). We’ve also included
              columns for if their powers were acquired or innate, as well as one for gender (red means male) Looking
              down the columns, we can see that super strength, speed, intelligence, and flight are much more common
              than, say, healing or magical powers. It seems as though the characters with the largest influence -
              Captain America, Iron Man, Thor – tend to also have a similar set of powers – super-strength, speed,
              intelligence – as well as a distinctive weapon and perhaps flight. On the other hand, characters with
              lower influence tend to be equipped with a different suite of powers and abilities.

        <p>
          After Endgame, it’s hard to imagine where the MCU might go next. Yet, many more movies are in the works - the
          so-called “Phase 4” of the MCU - including Black Widow, Spider-Man III, Black Panther II, and many more. With
          this next set of movies, only one thing is certain: comic book movies and the MCU are not going anywhere.
