              In April 2019, Marvel’s most recent film, <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> came out, promptly smashing just about every
              box office record there is to smash (as well as the Avengers facility and much of Upstate New York). 
              Not only did Endgame snag the record of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/22/20703487/avengers-endgame-avatar-biggest-movie-all-time-box-office">
              biggest opening weekend in the world at $1.2 billion</a>, but It blew past Avatar’s previous record of total box office revenue, reaching a
              new record of $2.79 billion in July.

            <p style="font-size:25px;">

              In fact, setting aside some notable exceptions like Avatar, it seems as though almost all the biggest
              movies these days are action-packed comic book stories adapted for the big screen. Let’s look at some data
              to see if this is really the case:

              Without a doubt, the most dominant franchises in the comic book movie genre are Marvel and DC.
              Both the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and DC Extended Universe (DCEU) have been churning out huge
              numbers of successful (and not so successful) movies, ever since Iron Man came out in 2008.
              Both stayed neck-and-neck in terms of yearly box office revenues until the mid 2010’s,
              after MCU’s Iron Man 2 came out. After that, it’s simply no contest: MCU is the dominant comic book movie franchise (sorry DC fans).

              One of the defining features (one might say, 'superpowers') of the MCU is the sheer number of characters
              and stories that have been woven into its single timeline.
              Beginning with Iron Man in 2008, MCU began producing movies with increasing frequency and increasing success.
              Now in 2019, there have been a total of 23 MCU movies from 11 different series, with plans for
              at least 7 more in the near future.

              In addition to the branching plots, the relations between each of the many main characters
              in MCU are highly complex. To get a sense of this, we downloaded the Wikipedia pages of each MCU main
              character using the Wikimedia API and extracted the links between character pages. Each link
              represents some sort of relation between the two characters. For example, if
              <span class="iron-man">Iron Man</span> links to <span class="hulk">Hulk</span>, then somewhere
              on <span class="iron-man">Iron Man</span>’s page is a reference to
              <span class="hulk">Hulk</span>, meaning that the two characters did something together.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:23px;">
              We analyzed this graph to determine who the most "important" character in the MCU was based on Wikipedia
              links. Drumroll please...

                Of course, the relationships between characters are only part of the story. These are superheros after
                all - what about their powers? We can look at two kinds of data: abilities (quantitative traits such as
                speed, strength, etc) and powers (specific superpowers such as healing, flight, etc.). Looking
                down the columns, we can see that super strength, speed, intelligence, and flight are much more common
                than, say, healing or magical powers. It seems as though the characters with the largest influence -
                Captain America, Iron Man, Thor – tend to also have a similar set of powers – super-strength, speed,
                intelligence – as well as a distinctive weapon and perhaps flight. On the other hand, characters with

          After Endgame, it’s hard to imagine where the MCU might go next. Yet, many more movies are in the works - the
          so-called “Phase 4” of the MCU - including Black Widow, Spider-Man III, Black Panther II, and many more. With
          this next set of movies, only one thing is certain: comic book movies and the MCU are not going anywhere.
